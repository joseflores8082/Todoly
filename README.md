### Planning

Plan out your steps and get started. Focus on functionality not styling for now.

### Todo object

{ id: someUniqueIdOnCreation, text: 'finish studying' }

for the id we can use the package uuid. Its already been installed.
You will need to import it and then run it where a UUID is needed.

import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'

uuidv4(); // â‡¨ '9b1deb4d-3b7d-4bad-9bdd-2b0d7b3dcb6d'

example:
{id: 1, text: 'finish studying' }

### Styling

Move onto styling and try to replicate the image above

### Testing

- Clicking on add
- Adding to list
- Clicking on delete
- Clicking on edit
- etc.
